# OCP 

### Java 11 SE code examples for the [1Z0-819 exam](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-11-developer/pexam_1Z0-819)

These are my preparation exercises for the OCP exam.

Each example is self-contained, executable code snippet.

Class and method names are usually meaningful, but not every time.
Despite that, it is more enjoyable to read code with seemingly redundant naming than frigging "foo" and bloody "bar".

Although I conceived code examples and data by myself, topics covered in the examples are created following this book:
