# OCP 

### Java 11 SE code examples for the [1Z0-819 exam](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-11-developer/pexam_1Z0-819)

These are my preparation exercises for the OCP exam.

Each example is self-contained, executable code snippet.

Class and method names are usually meaningful, but not every time.
Despite that, it is more enjoyable to read code with seemingly redundant naming than frigging "foo" and bloody "bar".

Code examples and data are mostly conceived by myself, supplemented by scattered tasks from murky GitHub repos. 

Topics covered in the examples are created following books:
